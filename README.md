## Features

The stock price prediction model includes the following features:

- ARIMA Model: Time-series forecasting using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.
- Machine Learning Models: Ensemble learning models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, for capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the code:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels

Install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the stock price prediction model:

   ```bash
   python stock_price_prediction.py
   ```

   This will execute the main script, which includes ARIMA modeling and machine learning models.

## Models

### ARIMA Model

The ARIMA model is implemented using the `statsmodels` library. It captures linear trends and seasonality in time series data.

### Machine Learning Models

Ensemble learning models, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, are implemented using the `scikit-learn` library. These models capture complex non-linear relationships in the data.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for regression tasks. Metrics for classification tasks (if applicable) can be added and evaluated based on the specific problem.
